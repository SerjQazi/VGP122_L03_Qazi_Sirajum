/* Define a function hypotenuse that calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle
when the other two sides are given. The function should take two double arguments
and return the hypotenuse as a double. Use this function in a program to determine
the hypotenuse for each of the triangles shown below. 

Triangle	Side 1		Side 2
1			3.0			4.0
2			5.0			12.0
3			8.0			15.0 */
